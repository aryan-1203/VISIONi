# VISIONi
Welcome to our comprehensive platform built specifically for Indian farmers using the MERN stackâ€”MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Our website serves as a one-stop solution designed to empower and support farmers with a range of valuable resources. Here, farmers can access insightful blogs and articles related to agriculture and government initiatives. We provide up-to-date information on the latest government schemes and policies benefiting farmers. Our marketplace allows farmers to explore and purchase tractors, equipment, and instruments at transparent prices. Additionally, farmers can list their products for sale. To further assist farmers, we have integrated Google Maps API, enabling them to locate the nearest shops for fertilizers and manures. Our goal is to create a supportive, informative, and accessible platform to help Indian farmers thrive.
